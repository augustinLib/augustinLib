  # ⭐️ Toward the Next Generation of Information Retrieval

  I'm a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University, advised by Professor Dongha Lee.
  <br>
  
  <b>🔥 My Mission</b><br>
  To help people in the real-world:<br>
  <b>1) Access accurate information without distortion</b><br>
  <b>2) Retrieve information more easily and intuitively</b><br>
  <b>3) Better understand and effectively utilize that information</b>
  
  <br>
  🔍 To achieve this, I have been conducting research about information retrieval.
  <br>
  📚 Specifically, I'm interested in information retrieval and natural language processing. 
  <br>
  💡 My research focuses on developing efficient retrieval systems and improving the quality of search results to help users find relevant information more effectively. 
  <br>
  🔠 I also explore the intersection of IR and NLP to enhance text understanding and information access.
